# Custom parts

As part of putting Rook together I designed a few parts either to work around
problems I had or to suit my needs for the printer better. They are described
below.

## `electronicsBox.stl` and `electronicsBoxLid.stl`

This is a box and lid that fits into the bottom part of the stock Rook base.
It has pass-throughs for cables so instead of designing mounts for all your
hardware you can just jam everything into this box. I beleive other Rook builders
have published electronics boxes but they do not use the stock bottom frame. 
I had already printed the stock frame so I wanted an electronics box that
would work with that.

## `ExtruderBottomText.stl`

This is a modified X axis motor mount that you can attach to the back left
of Rook to mount the extruder motor cleanly. Mounting the extruder motor at
the bottom of the machine helps to lower the center of gravity.

## `X_Carriage-40mm-extra-tall.stl`

The 40 mm fan was too large to fit on the stock hot end mount so I
modified it to fit this fan size. Seems to work well.
